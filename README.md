* If you already integrated push notification module using some other providers/plugins, you need to configure your app to work with Upshot push notification.

```Android

public class FcmMessageListenerService extends FirebaseMessagingService {
    
    @Override
    public void onMessageReceived(RemoteMessage message) {
        try {
            if (message.getData().size() > 0) {
                
                Bundle pushPayload = new Bundle();
                for (Map.EntryÂ entry : message.getData().entrySet()) {
                    pushPayload.putString(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());
                }
                if (pushPayload.containsKey("bk")) {
                    
                    UpshotPushPresenter.getInstance().sendNotification(remoteMessage.getData(), pushPayload, context);
                } else {
                    // not from Upshot handle yourself or pass to another provider
                }
            }
        } catch (Throwable t) {
        }
    }
}

```

## iOS Specific Instructions

### Rich push notifications:

iOS 10 brings us push notifications with Rich Media Attachment which includes viewing photos, videos, gifs and audio right there, within the notification. Having these media attachments as a part of your notification is achieved with the use of the new Notification Service Extension.

#### Create Notification Service Extension

In Xcode, select project > click on + > search Notification Service Extension and click on next.

#### If you want to use rich push notifications via Upshot implement below changes

* Add UpshotNotificationService.m class to Notification Service target

![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bk-purpletalk/shared_folder/media/images/1585591188199.png)

* import UpshotNotificationService.h class to NotificationService.h and make UpshotNotificationService as super class

```iOS
#import "UpshotNotificationService.h"
```

* Remove all the code and your NotificationService.m class should be like this.
